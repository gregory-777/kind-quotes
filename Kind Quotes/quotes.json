        "description": "Never ever discount the value of your act of kindness. It may be as simple as opening the door for someone or as grand as paying for someone's groceries. What ever the act may be, just know that your kindness is valued. You did not waste your time nor did you waste your energy, but you made someone's day just a little better."

        "description": "There are endless things you can be in this world that require some level of skill and training: an astronaut, a pilot, a nurse. Being kind doesn't require you to undergo any training or traverse through any course. It only requires a willingness to perform a kind act without expecting anything in return. This career is accessible to anyone, at any place, and any time."
